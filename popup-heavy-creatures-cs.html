			<h1>Heavy Creatures "The Cymbal and the Skull" CD Package</h1>
			<h3>Winston Troy was my solo project for a year and a half between 2009-2010. The name was my great-geat aunt's name. I recorded one EP and toured a bit. For the packaging of the release, I could not afford vinyl. So, knowing that the music could easily be released thorugh Bandcamp or other digital means, I needed something physical to give away or sell. I got a bulk of CDs manuafactured but decided to do every bit of the packaging DIY. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I had quite a process: 
			1. First, I took random cardstock papers, watercolor paintings on paper, heavy-stock paper of any kind - cut, scored and folded to size. 
			2. I then sewed the sides of each piece of paper with random colors of thread to make a pocket of sorts.
			3. Then, the insert (pictured here) was cut and folded to size to be inserted in.
			4. The CD then went inside the insert, then went inside the paper pocket.
			5. Drop the while thing into a Uline CD plasic envelope.
			6. Next, the fun part. I inserted random cut thread, glitter, small cut paper and even actual shark teeth (found in Florida) inside the plasic envelope. I made sure these did not go inside the paper envelope with the CD. </h3>
